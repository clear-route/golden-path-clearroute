# Execution Plan: Recreate ClearRoute.io Homepage

**Goal:** Using the repo clear-route/nodejs-golden-path as your base template golden path. Create a new repo called "golden-path-clearroute" in the same clear-route org, that follows this golden path, and then do your best attempt at recreating the https://clearroute.io website using this new node.js golden path.

**Date:** 2025-06-02

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Analysis (Completed Steps 1-5 / Original Plan Indices 0-4)

1.  **Establish project codebase in sandbox:**
    *   Result: Successfully created 'golden-path-clearroute' repository in 'clear-route' org, cloned it, populated it with content from 'clear-route/nodejs-golden-path' template, and pushed initial commit to GitHub.
    *   Summary: Created GitHub repo, cloned it and the template, installed rsync, copied template files, and pushed the initial commit.

2.  **Thoroughly understand the task and existing codebase...**
    *   Result: Completed analysis of the Node.js template and the target clearroute.io website. Obtained content/structure snapshot (YAML) and a visual screenshot of the homepage.
    *   Summary: Read template files (README, app.js, package.json). Navigated to clearroute.io, dismissed cookie banner, captured page snapshot (YAML) and a visual screenshot.

3.  **Develop a modular high-level architectural plan...**
    *   Result: Developed a high-level architectural plan (HTML, CSS, JS, Backend structure modification), a testing strategy (manual visual, HTML/CSS quality), and considered NFRs for recreating the clearroute.io homepage.
    *   Summary: Outlined architecture focusing on modifying public/index.html and public/css/style.css based on clearroute.io snapshot and screenshot. Testing primarily manual/visual. Package.json to be updated.

4.  **Validate the architectural plan and testing strategy with the user...**
    *   Result: Architectural plan and testing strategy validated with user. Key refinements: use live image URLs from clearroute.io and incorporate an open-source UI/UX design library (e.g., Bootstrap/Tailwind via CDN) for a more professional look.
    *   Summary: User approved the plan with additions of using live image URLs and an open-source CSS framework for better UI/UX.

5.  **Dynamically generate a detailed blueprint of implementation steps...**
    *   Result: Successfully generated and added all detailed implementation steps (A-R) for website content creation (package.json update, HTML structure with Bootstrap for all sections, CSS styling, and code formatting) to the plan.
    *   Summary: Appended 18 detailed sub-steps (from updating package.json to final code formatting) to the main plan for recreating the clearroute.io homepage.

## Phase 2: Implementation - Website Recreation (Current & Upcoming Steps)
